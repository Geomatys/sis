==============================================
Welcome to Apache SIS <https://sis.apache.org>
==============================================

SIS is a Java language library for developing geospatial applications.
The library is an implementation of GeoAPI 3.0.1 interfaces and can be used
for desktop or server applications. Apache SIS provides data structures for
geographic features and associated metadata along with methods to manipulate
those data structures. The SIS metadata module forms the base of the library
and enables the creation of metadata objects which comply with the ISO 19115
international standard. The SIS referencing module enable the construction of
geodetic data structures for geospatial referencing as defined by ISO 19111
standard, along with the associated operations which enable the transformation
of coordinates between different reference systems. The SIS storage modules
provide a common approach to the reading and writing of metadata, features and
coverages applicable to simple imagery as to many dimensional data structures.

SIS is a project of the Apache Software Foundation <https://www.apache.org/>.
