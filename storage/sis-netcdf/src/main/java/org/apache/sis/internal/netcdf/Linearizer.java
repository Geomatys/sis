/**
 * Two-dimensional non-linear transforms to try in attempts to make a localization grid more linear.
 * Non-linear transforms are tested in "trials and errors" and the one resulting in best correlation
 * coefficients is selected. This enumeration identifies which linearizers to try for a given file.
 *
 * <p>When a non-linear transform exists in spherical or ellipsoidal variants, we use the spherical
 * formulas instead than ellipsoidal formulas because the spherical ones are faster and more stable
 * (because the inverse transforms are exact, up to rounding errors).  The errors caused by the use
 * of spherical formulas are compensated by the localization grid used after the linearizer.</p>
