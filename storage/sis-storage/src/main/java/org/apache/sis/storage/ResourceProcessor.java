     * Returns a coverage resource with sample values converted by the given functions.
     * The number of sample dimensions in the returned coverage is the length of the {@code converters} array,

     * If the {@code converters} array length is less than the number of source sample dimensions,
     * then all sample dimensions at index â‰¥ {@code converters.length} will be ignored.
     *
     * <h4>Sample dimensions customization</h4>
     * By default, this method creates new sample dimensions with the same names and categories than in the
     * previous coverage, but with {@linkplain org.apache.sis.coverage.Category#getSampleRange() sample ranges}
     * converted using the given converters and with {@linkplain SampleDimension#getUnits() units of measurement}
     * omitted. This behavior can be modified by specifying a non-null {@code sampleDimensionModifier} function.
     * If non-null, that function will be invoked with, as input, a pre-configured sample dimension builder.
     * The {@code sampleDimensionModifier} function can {@linkplain SampleDimension.Builder#setName(CharSequence)
     * change the sample dimension name} or {@linkplain SampleDimension.Builder#categories() rebuild the categories}.
     *
     * <h4>Result relationship with source</h4>
     * If the source coverage is backed by a {@link java.awt.image.WritableRenderedImage},
     * then changes in the source coverage are reflected in the returned coverage and conversely.
