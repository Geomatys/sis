/**
 * A resource whose range is the aggregation of the ranges of a sequence of resources.
 * This class combines homogeneous {@link GridCoverageResource}s by "stacking" their bands.
 * The grid geometry is typically the same for all resources, but some variations described below are allowed.
 * The number of sample dimensions in the aggregated coverage is the sum of the number of sample dimensions in
 * each individual resource, unless a subset of sample dimensions is specified.
 *
 * <h2>Restrictions</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>All resources shall use the same coordinate reference system (CRS).</li>
 *   <li>All resources shall have the same {@linkplain GridCoverageResource#getGridGeometry() domain}, except
 *       for the grid extent and the translation terms which can vary by integer amounts of grid cells.</li>
 *   <li>All grid extents shall intersect and the intersection area shall be non-empty.</li>
 *   <li>If coverage data are stored in {@link java.awt.image.RenderedImage} instances,
 *       then all images shall use the same data type.</li>
