/**
 * List of {@code PolylineBuffer} coordinates that have not yet been closed.
 * Each {@code double[]} in this list is a copy of a {@link PolylineBuffer} used by {@link Tracer.Level}.
 * Those copies are performed for saving data before they are overwritten by next iterated cell.
 *
 * <h2>List indices and ordering of points</h2>
 * For a given {@code Fragments} list, all {@code double[]} arrays at even indices shall have their points read
 * in reverse order and all {@code double[]} arrays at odd indices shall have their points read in forward order.
 * The list size must be even and the list may contain null elements when there is no data in the corresponding
 * iteration order. This convention makes easy to reverse the order of all points, simply by reversing the order
 * of {@code double[]} arrays: because even indices become odd and odd indices become even, points order are
 * implicitly reverted without the need to rewrite all {@code double[]} array contents.
