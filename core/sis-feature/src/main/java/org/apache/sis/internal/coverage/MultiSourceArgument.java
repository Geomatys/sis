/**
 * Helper class for building a combined domain or range from aggregated sources.
 * This helper class is shared for aggregation operations on different sources:
 * rendered images, grid coverages and resources.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class should be short-lived.
 * They are used only the time needed for constructing an image or coverage operation.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class can optionally verify if some sources are themselves aggregated images or coverages.
 * This is done by an {@link #unwrap(Consumer)}, which should be invoked in order to get a flattened
 * view of nested aggregations.</p>
 *
 * <p>All methods in this class may return direct references to internal arrays.
 * This is okay if instances of this class are discarded immediately after usage.</p>
