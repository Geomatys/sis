/**
 * Parent classes for computed images that are <em>potentially</em> writable.
 * This class implements some {@link WritableRenderedImage} methods such as
 * the methods for adding or removing tile listeners. However this class does
 * <em>not</em> implement the {@link WritableRenderedImage} interface itself.
 * It is up to subclasses to implement that interface explicitly
 * when they have determined that the image is effectively writable.
 *
 * <h2>Usage pattern</h2>
 * Create a package-private read-only image by extending this class as if
 * {@link ComputedImage} was extended directly. Ignore all public methods
 * defined in this class. Do not make the class public for preventing users
 * users to access those public methods.
 *
 * <p>Create a package-private writable image as a subclass of above read-only image.
 * Override {@link #setData(Raster)}, {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()}.
 * The latter two methods need to be overridden for restoring the identity behavior
 * for writable image, because it may have listeners attached to this specific instance.
 * Example:</p>
 *
 * {@snippet lang="java" :
 * class MyOperation extends WritableComputedImage {
 *
 *     // Constructors omitted for brevity.
 *
 *     static final class Writable extends MyOperation implements WritableRenderedImage {
 *         @Override
 *         public void setData(Raster data) {
 *             // Write data back to original images here.
 *         }
 *
 *         @Override
 *         public boolean equals(final Object object) {
 *             return object == this;
 *         }
 *
 *         @Override
 *         public int hashCode() {
 *             return System.identityHashCode(this);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * }
