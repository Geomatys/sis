/**
 * Iterator for the {@link SequenceType#LINEAR} traversal order.
 * This iterator behaves as is the whole image was a single tile.
 * Calls to {@link #next()} move the current position by increasing the following values, in order:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Column index in image (from left to right)</li>
 *   <li>Row index in image (from top to bottom).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * This class uses the {@link Raster} API for traversing the pixels of the image,
 * i.e. it does not yet provide optimization for commonly used sample models.
