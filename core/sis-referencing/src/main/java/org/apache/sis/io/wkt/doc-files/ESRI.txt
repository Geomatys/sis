# Example file for org.apache.sis.io.wkt.ReferencingFactory.
# This file provides Coordinate Reference System definitions
# in Well-Known Text (WKT) format. One or many files can be
# used for extending the set of CRS with custom definitions.
#
# Each Coordinate Reference System (or other geodetic object)
# is defined by a string in WKT format. The key associated to
# each object is given by the ID[…] or AUTHORITY[…] element,
# which is typically the last element of a WKT string and is
# mandatory for definitions in this file.
#
# WKT strings can span many lines. All lines after the first
# line shall be indented with at least one white space.
# Non-indented lines start new definitions.
#
# All lines starting with the # character are comment lines.
#
# ---- Aliases for WKT fragments ---------------------------
# Files with more than one WKT definition tend to repeat the
# same WKT fragments many times, e.g. the same BaseGeogCRS[…]
# element may be repeated in every ProjectedCRS definitions.
# Redundant fragments can be replaced by aliases for making
# the file more compact, easier to read, faster to parse and
# with smaller memory footprint.
#
# Each line starting with "SET <identifier>=<WKT>" defines
# an alias for a fragment of WKT string.  The WKT can span
# many lines as described above.  Aliases are local to the
# file where they are defined.  Aliases can be expanded in
# other WKT strings by "$<identifier>".
#

#
# Alias for WGS84 geographic CRS.
# Can be inserted in projected CRS with "$WGS84".
