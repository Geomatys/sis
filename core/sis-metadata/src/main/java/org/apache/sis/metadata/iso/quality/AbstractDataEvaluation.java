 *   <li>Instances of this class are not synchronized for multi-threading.
 *       Synchronization, if needed, is caller's responsibility.</li>
 *   <li>Serialized objects of this class are not guaranteed to be compatible with future Apache SIS releases.
 *       Serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the
 *       same version of Apache SIS. For long term storage, use {@link org.apache.sis.xml.XML} instead.</li>
