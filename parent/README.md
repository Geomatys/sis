# Apache SIS parent POM
This directory contains the `pom.xml` file used as the parent of all Apache SIS Maven modules.
It also opportunistically contains resources shared by many modules.

## Prerequisites
Maven must be available on the classpath.
The parent is built by a call to `mvn clean install`.
This call is done automatically by the Gradle build.
