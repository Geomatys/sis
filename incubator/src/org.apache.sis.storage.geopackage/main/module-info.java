/**
 * A data store for reading and writing Geopackage files.
 * This module is based on the {@link org.apache.sis.storage.sql} module,
 * which is extended for supporting the {@code "gpkg_contents"} table.
 *
 * <h2>Generalization</h2>
 * At reading time, this module is more flexible than required by the Geopackage standard:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The database can be any <abbr>JDBC</abbr> compliant database, not necessarily SQLite.</li>
 *   <li>Feature and attribute tables can have any number of geometry columns, including zero.
 *       By contrast, the Geopackage standard restricts feature tables to one geometry column,
 *       and attribute tables to zero geometry column.</li>
 *   <li><dfn>Complex features</dfn> (i.e., features having associations to other features) are supported.
 *       The associations are discovered automatically by following the foreigner keys.</li>
 *   <li>Primary keys are optional, can be composite (made of many columns) and are not restricted to integer type.</li>
 * </ul>
