/**
 * Provides the thread pool for JavaFX application. This thread pool is different than the pool used by
 * the {@link org.apache.sis.internal.system.CommonExecutor} shared by the rest of Apache SIS library.
 * Contrarily to {@code CommonExecutor}, this {@code BackgroundThreads} class always allocates threads
 * to new tasks immediately (no queuing of tasks), no matter if all processors are already busy or not.
 * The intent is to have quicker responsiveness to user actions, even at the cost of lower throughput.
 * Another difference is that the threads used by this class are not daemon threads in order to not stop
 * for example in the middle of a write operation.
 *
 * <p>This class extends {@link AtomicInteger} for opportunistic reason.
 * Users should not rely on this implementation details.</p>
