/**
 * Workaround for the absence of public {@code clone()} method in the standard interface.
 * The purpose of this interface is to avoid the following exception when {@link Cloner}
 * tries to clone a class defined in an internal package of another module:
 *
 * <blockquote>{@link IllegalAccessException}: class {@link Cloner}
 * (in module {@code org.apache.sis.util}) cannot access class <var>Foo</var>
 * (in module <var>bar</var>) because module <var>bar</var> does not export
 * <var>foo</var> to module {@code org.apache.sis.util}</blockquote>
 *
 * This workaround is needed only for Apache SIS internal classes, because {@link Cloner}
 * usage of reflection should work for exported packages.
 *
 * <p>This interface may be removed in any future Apache SIS version if we find a better
 * way to workaround the lack of public {@code clone()} method in {@link Cloneable}.</p>
