/**
 * A test method producing an object to be used by another test method.
 * This annotation is for documentation purpose only. It is used in replacement to
 * {@link org.junit.jupiter.api.Test} when the method is invoked by another method.
 * It may be because the methods need to be invoked inside a {@code try â€¦ finally}
 * block, or because the result of a test is used by a next step.
 *
 * <p>We currently do not use {@link org.junit.jupiter.api.TestMethodOrder} annotation for
 * the purposes described above because the semantic during parallel execution is unclear,
 * and we do not want to force {@code Lifecycle.PER_CLASS} on those tests.</p>
