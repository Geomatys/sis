/**
 * Visitor used to copy expressions and filters with same parameterized types.
 * This class can be used when some filters need to be recreated with the same types
 * but potentially different values. For example a change of {@link Literal} value
 * requires to recreate all parents in the filter graph.
 *
 * <h2>Partially implemented factory</h2>
 * {@code EditVisitor} relaxes the usual factory API contract by allowing unsupported factory
 * methods to return {@code null} instead of throwing an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * A null value is interpreted as an instruction to continue to use the old filter or expression,
 * without replacing it by a new instance created by the {@linkplain #factory}.
 * By contrast, an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} causes the copy operation to fail.
