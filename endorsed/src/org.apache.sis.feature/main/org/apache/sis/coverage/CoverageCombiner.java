/**
 * Combines an arbitrary number of coverages into a single one.
 * The combined coverages may use different coordinate systems.
 * The workflow is as below:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Creates a {@code CoverageCombiner} with the destination coverage where to write.</li>
 *   <li>Configure with methods such as {@link #setInterpolation setInterpolation(…)}.</li>
 *   <li>Invoke {@link #acceptAll acceptAll(…)} methods for each list of coverages to combine.</li>
 *   <li>Get the combined coverage with {@link #result()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Coverage domains can have any number of dimensions.
 * Coverages are combined in the order they are specified.
 * For each coverage, sample dimensions are combined in the order they appear, regardless their names.
 * For each sample dimension, values are converted to the unit of measurement of the destination coverage.
 *
 * <h2>Limitations</h2>
 * The current implementation has the following limitations.
 * Those restrictions may be resolved progressively in future Apache SIS versions.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Supports only {@link GridCoverage} instances, not yet more generic coverages.</li>
 *   <li>No interpolation except in the two dimensions having the largest size (usually the 2 first).
 *       For all other dimensions, data are taken from the nearest neighbor two-dimensional slice.</li>
 *   <li>No expansion of the destination coverage for accommodating data of source coverages
 *       that are outside the destination coverage bounds.</li>
 * </ul>
