     * Provides the expected type of values produced by this expression when a feature of a given type is evaluated.

     * but not an {@code Operation}. The value of the static property will be set to the result of
     * evaluating the expression when instances of the {@code FeatureType} will be created.
     * This evaluation will be performed by {@link FeatureProjection#apply(AbstractFeature)}.
     *
     * <h4>Implementation guideline</h4>
     * Implementations should declare the property by invoking some of the following methods:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@link FeatureProjectionBuilder#source()} for the source of the {@link PropertyType} in next point.</li>
     *   <li>{@link FeatureProjectionBuilder#addSourceProperty(AbstractIdentifiedType, boolean)}</li>
     *   <li>{@link FeatureProjectionBuilder#addComputedProperty(PropertyTypeBuilder, boolean)}</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * Inherited methods such as {@link FeatureProjectionBuilder#addAttribute(Class)} can also be invoked,
     * but callers will be responsible for providing the value of the properties added by those methods.
     * These values will not be provided by {@link FeatureProjection#apply(AbstractFeature)}.
     *
     * <h4>Operations</h4>
     * If the property is a link to another property, such as {@code "sis:identifier"} or {@code "sis:geometry"},
     * then adding this property may require the addition of dependencies. These dependencies will be detected by
     * {@link FeatureProjectionBuilder}, which may generate an intermediate {@code FeatureType}.
     *
     * @param  addTo  where to add the type of the property evaluated by this expression.
     * @return handler of the added property, or {@code null} if the property cannot be added.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if this expression is invalid for the requested operation.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the property was not found in {@code addTo.source()}.
     * @throws UnconvertibleObjectException if the property default value cannot be converted to the expected type.
