/**
 * A feature containing a subset of the properties of another feature.
 * The feature type of the view must be specified in argument together with the source feature instance.
 * All properties that are present in this feature view shall have the same name as in the source feature.
 * This class does not verify that requirement.
 *
 * <h2>Limitations</h2>
 * For performance and simplicity reasons, the current implementation does not prevent users
 * from requesting a property that exists in the full feature instance but not in this subset.
 *
 * <h2>Possible evolution</h2>
 * It would be possible for the view to contain operations that are not present in the source features.
 * This extension has not yet been implemented because not yet needed.
