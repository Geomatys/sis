/**
 * Base class of grid coverage resource storing data in tiles.
 * The word "tile" is used for simplicity but can be understood
 * as "chunk" in a <var>n</var>-dimensional generalization.
 * Subclasses need to implement the following methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #getGridGeometry()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getSampleDimensions()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getTileSize()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getSampleModel(int[])} (optional but recommended)</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getColorModel(int[])} (optional but recommended)</li>
 *   <li>{@link #read(GridGeometry, int...)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The read method can be implemented simply as below:
 *
 * {@snippet lang="java" :
 *     @Override
 *     public GridCoverage read(GridGeometry domain, int... ranges) throws DataStoreException {
 *         synchronized (getSynchronizationLock()) {
 *             var subset = new Subset(domain, ranges);
 *             var result = new MySubclassOfTiledGridCoverage(this, subset);
 *             return preload(result);
