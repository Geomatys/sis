 * A seekable byte channel which copies data from an input stream to a temporary file.

 * Characteristics:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Bytes read from the input stream are cached in a temporary file for making backward seeks possible.</li>
 *   <li>The range of bytes of interest {@linkplain #rangeOfInterest(long, long) can be specified}.
 *       It makes possible to specify the range of bytes to download with HTTP connections.</li>
 *   <li>This implementation is thread-safe.</li>
 *   <li>Current implementation is read-only.</li>
 * </ul>
