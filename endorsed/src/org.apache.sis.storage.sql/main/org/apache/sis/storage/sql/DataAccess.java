/**
 * Low-level accesses to the database content.
 * This class provides a <abbr>SQL</abbr> {@link Connection} to the database,
 * sometime protected by read or write lock (it may depend on which database driver is used).
 * The connection can be used for custom <abbr>SQL</abbr> queries or updates.
 * This class also provides helper method for performing queries or updates in the {@code "SPATIAL_REF_SYS"} table
 * (the table name may vary depending on the spatial schema used by the database).
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * {@code DataAccess} instances are created by calls to {@link SQLStore#newDataAccess(boolean)}.
 * The Boolean argument tells whether the caller may perform write operations. That flag determines
 * not only the {@linkplain Connection#setReadOnly(boolean) read-only state} of the connection,
 * but also whether to acquire a {@linkplain ReadWriteLock#readLock() read lock}
 * or a {@linkplain ReadWriteLock#writeLock() write lock} if locking is needed.
 *
 * <p>This object shall be used in a {@code try ... finally} block for ensuring that the connection
 * is closed and the lock (if any) released. Note that the <abbr>SQL</abbr> connection does not need
 * to be closed by users, because it will be closed by the {@link #close()} method of this data access
 * object. Example:</p>
 *
 * {@snippet lang="java" :
 *   SQLStore store = ...;
 *   try (DataAccess dao = store.newDataAccess(false)) {
 *       Connection cnx = dao.getConnection();
 *       try (Statement stmt = cnx.createStatement()) {
 *           // Perform some SQL queries here.
 *       }
 *   }
 *   }
 *
 * <h2>Multi-threading</h2>
 * This class is not thread safe. Each instance should be used by a single thread.
 *
